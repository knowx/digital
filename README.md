### Digital Twin
*Digital twin refers to a digital replica of physical assets, processes and systems that can be used for various purposes.* 
*The digital representation provides both the elements and the dynamics of how an Internet of Things device operates and lives throughout its life cycle.*

*Digital twins integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and software analytics with data to create living digital simulation models that update and change as their physical counterparts change. A digital twin continuously learns and updates itself from multiple sources to represent its near real-time status, working condition or position. This learning system, learns from itself, using sensor data that conveys various aspects of its operating condition; from human experts, such as engineers with deep and relevant industry domain knowledge; from other similar machines; from other similar fleets of machines; and from the larger systems and environment in which it may be a part of. A digital twin also integrates historical data from past machine usage to factor into its digital model.*

*In various industrial sectors, twins are being used to optimize the operation and maintenance of physical assets, systems and manufacturing processes.They are a formative technology for the Industrial Internet of Things, where physical objects can live and interact with other machines and people virtually.*
